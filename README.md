# Defaff Linux
Linux distribution as defaffware - powerful sans the faff
## Design Philosophy
### Sans the Faff
Complexity is not the enemy; complexity is the cost, and that cost is both upfront and ongoing. Complexity, both inside and out, must be ruthlessly justified, because unjustified complexity is faff, and faff has no business here.
### Instant Responsiveness
This isn't about being fast, some things need to crunch, this is about instant feedback on every user interaction. Keystrokes and clicks should feel like they land just before they are pressed. There should also be no mystery waiting - spinning wheels are a cop out.
### Focus is Everything
Desktop environments should be about productivity and entertainment. Notifications are an abomination to both.
### Lightweight is Green
Minimal resource utilisation is not just good for keeping things fast, when you consider scale, it's also good for the planet. This may be a bold statement for a humble fledgling distro, but, in this, we should all be pitching in.
### Mind the Learning Curve
Powerful features sometimes comes at the cost of UI complexity. Vertical walls in the learning curve are rude, but don't just push the vertical wall deeper. Provide a gradual and meaningful path to learning powerful tools, with minimal trivia.
