# Defaff Linux
Linux distribution as defaffware - powerful sans the faff
## Design Philosophy
* **sans the faff**: Complexity is not the enemy; complexity is the cost, and that cost is both upfront and ongoing. Complexity, both inside and out, must be ruthlessly justified, because unjustified complexity is faff, and faff has no business here.
* **instant responsiveness**: This isn't about being fast, some things need to crunch, this is about instant feedback on every user interaction. Keystrokes and clicks should feel like they land just before they are pressed. There should also be no mystery waiting - spinning wheels are a cop out.
* **focus is everything**: Desktop environments should be about productivity and entertainment. Notifications are an abomination to both.
