# Defaff Linux
Linux distribution as defaffware - powerful sans the faff
## Design Philosophy
Complexity is not the enemy; complexity is the cost, and that cost is both upfront and ongoing. Complexity, both inside and out, must be ruthlessly justified, because unjustified complexity is faff, and faff has no business here.
